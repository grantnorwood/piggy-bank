# PiggyBank

**Bacon-powered banking!** üê∑

## Getting Started

_To run this example, simply:_

1. Clone this repo locally _(`git clone git@github.com:grantnorwood/piggy-bank.git`)_
2. If you'd like to run in dev mode _(no pin required)_, change `isDevelopment: true` in [App.tsx](./src/App.tsx)
3. Start the app by running `yarn start`
4. **Bring home that bacon!**

## To-Do

_Here's a list of to-do items that I would implement if I had more time ..._

- Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Add Types for most classes/functions/etc (set strict to true in tsconfig)
- Add mobile breakpoints
- Write unit/e2e tests
- Abstract away the localStorage calls
- Add a real db
- Lots more input validation
- Add real auth (via jwt, most likely)
- Componentize all the things!  (well, most of the things ...)
- Use selectors for pulling values out of app state
- Verify a11y works for people with various usability impairments

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
